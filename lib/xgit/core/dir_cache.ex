defmodule Xgit.Core.DirCache do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  A directory cache records the current (intended) contents of a working tree
  when last scanned or created by git.

  In Xgit, the `DirCache` structure is an abstract, in-memory data structure
  without any tie to a specific persistence mechanism. Persistence is implemented
  by a specific implementation of the `Xgit.Repository` behaviour.

  This content is commonly persisted on disk as an `index` file at the root of
  the git tree. The module `Xgit.Repository.WorkingTree.ParseIndexFile` can
  parse that file format.

  Changes in the working tree can be detected by comparing the modification times
  to the cached modification time within the dir cache.

  Index files are also used during merges, where the merge happens within the
  index file first, and the working directory is updated as a post-merge step.
  Conflicts are stored in the index file to allow tool (and human) based
  resolutions to be easily performed.
