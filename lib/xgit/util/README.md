**IMPORTANT:** As of version 0.3.0, the modules in this folder (named `Xgit.Util.*`)
are not part of the public API of xgit. Though they are technically accessible from outside
the xgit application, you should not depend on them.

Changes to any `Xgit.Util.*` API will occur without notice and will not be considered
API breaking for purposes of semantic versioning.
